#This is a simple website I coded from scratch to document COVID-19 stats while also practicing the CSS grid and using Fetch with APIs. 

Website can be seen live at : http://documentingcorona.com/world.html

To do this weekend: Add proxy to API fetch to fix CORS error as current US stats are not rendering (09/03/2020).
